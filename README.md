# Music Genre Classification

This project focuses on techniques for extracting features from audio data using the the Librosa library. The extracted features will then be used to train a music genre classifier implemented in Tensorflow.

The GTZAN dataset used in this project contains 10 classes, each class with a 100 of different 30 seconds audio files. The classes include blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae and rock.
